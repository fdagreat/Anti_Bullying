"Just like any other day, employees arrived in the workplace sparingly, filling the cubicles and getting their coffees ready. Once more, the manager was already sitting at his desk, grumbling and shouting - You’re way too slow, again! How am I supposed to get my work done with you slowing me down every day? The other employees were staring at each other. They were embarrassed by his outburst but deep inside they knew he was right. Satisfied by the nods in the assembly, the manager calmed down. As usual, he quickly got absorbed by his screen and numerous emails. He was not the moody type, just a normal guy. His team liked him very much and his performance record was exemplary. He was often described as someone caring and trustworthy with a genuine interest in people. Yet once again, his fist hit the desk loudly as he started screaming. That’s it, I’m done! Slow and unreliable old crap! You made me lose five hours of my life, again. World will be better off without you and I’m going to let the board know about that. He stood up suddenly and clenched his fists in anger. He then walked rapidly to the stairs, climbed and disappeared. Nobody saw him again for the day, but they all knew he was going for a confrontation, if not a fight. It was going to get really ugly up there.",0,,
"My so-called ‘friends’ in middle school used to call me Samara. Yes, the dead demon girl in The Ring. Apparently, I looked like her!",1,,
"i have been called hurtful names and i have been called black bitch and people are making fun of me for being black by my suppost to be friend t and she has posted rumors about me and i dont know what to do.",1,,
"at my old school kids would hit me and call me names one time one of them ran into me and i hit my head on the floor and after i felt like someone was stabbing my head all weekend at first i didn’t tell my mom but it ended up getting so bad that i had to transfer. Now I don't know how will I cope in a new environment with new people, I fear I would end up in a similar situation?",1,,
"I had debilitating migraines for three years because of the toxic work environment I was in. It took a two-week vacation (which included the stress of my own wedding) with absolutely NO migraines to finally realize the cause. I quit in June. I can count on one hand how many migraines I have had since, when I was getting on average one a week prior to leaving.",0,,
"I love my work, but hate going each day because of my supervisor. I would get physically ill knowing when she would be around. Emails from her gives me serious anxiety and hives. If she request any meetings, I would have stress attacks and cold sweats. I didn’t sleep, constantly worrying about work ― and was ill frequently. I ended up in the ICU last week at 36 years old and have serious work-induced anxiety.",0,,
"I have a chronic illness which was doing well enough for me to work. However, after a year of that toxic environment, my symptoms were getting worse. I could not function. It increased my depression. I developed a teeth-grinding problem. It was a horrible time.",0,,
"The other part is that sense of worthlessness. I struggle with this every day and have been looking for another job. The problem is no one else wants me, and it makes me feel worse when the only job that does views me as highly expendable and useless.",0,,
"I feel my whole body hurting. My mental health went down so much. I remember being on vacation worried so much about work that I checked my phone instead of spending time with my family.",0,,
"As a librarian, I've been threatened with stalking for not giving my phone number to a patron. I've also been shown naked, sexually explicit photos; and propositioned by countless men, some of which were married and standing right next to their children. Some of my female colleagues have had male patrons waiting for them in the parking lot after work, and they've received explicit messages over social media.",2,,
"I worked as an office manager, and the only woman, for an industrial insulation company. I had just come back from maternity leave and I was worried about my milk supply. I went into the bathroom to pump for about 15 minutes every two hours, and all of the men in the office would stand in the break area (right in front of the bathroom door) and make baby crying noises to make fun of me. Eventually it progressed to the point that they would make crying noises every time they passed my desk in hopes that I would leak through my shirt. They would also make comments about how much larger my breasts were since having a baby. I felt so harassed and unsafe that I would dread going to work every day, and I even had more than a few nervous breakdowns. My husband was furious and I had to convince him not to take any drastic action so that I could be sure to have a good reference if I needed to find another job. We had a long conversation and looked at our finances and decided the extra money wasn't worth the emotional distress. I ended up quitting my job and staying home with our kids.",2,,
"I used to work for a call center and the men there were extremely disgusting, always muttering sexual comments. The worst one I had was from a co-worker who used to message me on the work chat room, asking me to come blow him under his desk. When I reported it to HR they said I was the one causing the issue.",2,,
"When I was 13 or 14, I was babysitting two kids and some other kids came over for a play date, so I ended up watching them too. I got a ride home from the dad of one of the kids who'd come over. Earlier, I had noticed him staring at me specifically my chest but I didn’t think much of it. When we got in the car, he asked me where I went to school (normal), what I did outside of school (a little weird, but eh) and if I had a boyfriend (creepy). I, being an innocent lil nerd, proceeded to talk about the classes I was taking and how time-consuming but fun they were. I remember feeling flattered that he asked me so many questions about my life and seemed to listen to my response. I lived close by, so luckily I was home before anything could happen. As I was leaving the car, he asked for my phone number to contact me to babysit (which, again, is weird in retrospect because his daughters said they had a live-in nanny who usually watched them). I didn’t have a cell at the time and told him to ask the people I babysat for regularly to send him my email. He looked kinda mad, but by this point, I was out of the car and walking up the stairs to my front door.",2,,
"I work in law enforcement. I started out as a correctional officer in an all-male prison. When I was walking to my post one day an inmate screamed at me, 'Bitch, I'll beat your pussy so hard it'll put you in the hospital.' I called a unit code because to me, that is harassment. Violent sexual harassment. But because I worked in a male prison, I was supposed to let it go in one ear and out the other.",2,,
"I’m a waitress, and I get harassed daily by customers trying to order. The kitchen staff openly comments on female servers and female managers. The saddest thing is that it’s never properly addressed because cooks always have more job security than servers. I’ve even had a male manager tell me straight up that anybody can take that Coke to that table, but not everyone can make an omelette.",2,,
"I got made fun of for being fat in elementary, middle, and even high school. People would always go out of their way to tell me how fat I was and how unattractive that made me, especially in comparison to other girls. My nickname in third through fifth grade was ‘sumo wrestler,’ and once a boy drew a sumo wrestler on the blackboard and labeled it with my name. Even today, objectively knowing I am a pretty small person, I always feel fat. I’m working to unlearn harmful beauty standards and body dysmorphia, but years of bullying means I get triggered in the most unexpected ways, like when I’m at the beach or when a fat girl is made fun of in a movie.",1,,
"My whole life I’ve had a speech impediment where my ‘R’s sound funny, but it wasn’t until middle school when I started getting bullied about it. My best friend’s name was Sarah and mean girls would make fun of the way I said her name. Fast forward to now, we’re all seniors in high school. To this day my friends will still poke fun at my speech, and they don’t know how badly it hurts.",1,,
"I was fresh off of moving to a new town and entering my freshman year in a high school where I knew nobody. Nobody likes ‘fresh meat,’ especially girls. That first week I introduced myself in every class — so people would at least know my name — which severely backfired during gym. A guy started talking to me and the whole time, these two girls were whispering to each other while looking directly at me. I later found out that the boy was dating one of the girls. The girls spread rumors that I was a slut and I was hearing how I hooked up with all these boys after the first week. Mind you, I had never met any of the guys I had apparently hooked up with. So I had to pretty much start from negative scratch to build a reputation I actually liked for myself while everyone else was calling me a slut for unknowingly talking to someone else’s boyfriend.",1,,
"One time, my freshman year of high school, I was wearing weird Nike sneakers. This girl who hated and bullied me walked into the bathroom, saw my shoes, and said, ‘Oh my god, I love your shoes.’ She then walked out and I kid you not, it was like Regina George in Mean Girls scene where she compliments the skirt and then when the girl walks away, she says, ‘That’s the ugliest effing skirt I’ve ever seen.",1,,
"I’ve always been super flat-chested and I’m still totally traumatized by something that happened in seventh grade. These two guys came up to me and asked if they could call me stingray ‘because you’re really flat.’ I’m pretty sure the name continued for the rest of that school year.",1,,
"yesterday during lunchbreak thoe girls called me witch from Adam's family. I didn't have guts to speak to my mother about this. It was horrible experience, please guide me to do something regarding this.",1,,
"Ever since first grade, my three best friends and I were a super tight clique. In the fifth grade, another girl tried to slide into the friendship. We were pretty nice to her face, but we didn’t want her to be part of the group, so we devised a strategy that summer. While I was on vacation with my family, my other three friends acted close to her and let her be the temporary fourth member. When I got back, one of my friends placed a secret three-way call with me and the girl. I would stay silent on the line, while my friend would encourage the girl to say mean things about me, and then I would reveal that I was on the phone too, and she could never be our friend now. I’m pretty sure we got the idea from Mean Girls. My friends and I got in trouble for bullying after the girl’s mom called our moms crying.",1,,
"Hi, I'm Rahul. I was bullied all through school. One bully stood out. Rakesh Kumar, he bullied me all through junior high. he would say things to me like im gonna beat you up on the last day of school, he knew some students at another high school that if Rakesh paid them enough money they would beat me up! he said that I was ignorant. Rakesh said he couldn’t wait to go to his new school so he wouldn’t have to put up with me. I asked Rakesh why are you doing this to me? Rakesh said look at me and look at you. he thought because he was bigger than me that it made ok for Rakesh to bully me. My parents and I told the school, nothing was done about it. Rakesh never laid a hand on me. Its a good thing cause if Rakesh did something to hurt me he would have been in big trouble.",1,,
"I was born with a craniofacial disease called Stickler Syndrome, which I inherited from my mother . Oddly, my mother does not know where she got our commonly shared disease from. This disease has caused me to be severely nearsighted, have bad hearing, a short nose, a slightly flat face, and has caused me to experience some slight symptoms of scoliosis at a young age . As a kid, I’ve had several consultations about having reconstructive surgery on my nose, I have had hearing aids, and I have incredibly thick glasses . This disease has also taken a huge toll on my self esteem, as I’ve been bullied, not only by kids, but by adults as well. I remember one time being at a family friends house and hearing a guest say “That’s one ugly child.” Kids also would refer to me as “four eyes” and “ugly”.",1,,
"High school and junior high were hell for me. Every day guys from adjacent classes would push me over, threaten me with knives, nails, or what ever sharp objects they had. I developed severe chronical depression and due to family problems I didn’t dare to speak at home. Some of my friends noticed that I went from a semi-loud guy to a quiet one, and instead of asking the reason they decided to spy on me to find out why did I go quiet. The bullying got harder, then comes summer, after which high school. naturally I was hoping for a fresh start but no. A bully just had to choose the same high school and immediatly started to rumour about my “skin disease that kills” I made a few new friends and I finally had enough. I told my friends what was going on, and for all I know the bully disappeared from school. If you are a bully Stop it. It isn’t gonna help you. And if you’re bullied either tell a staff member, or your friends.",1,,
"My bullying started, or when I first noticed it, when I was in around class 2. There were two boys that were two grades higher than me and always called me names like ugly and useless. That wasn’t the worst of it though. One day on the bus one of the boys decided to “play a game” by me answering random facts about him. I didn’t have a choice in the matter since I was so young. When I lost the game, he pulled out a rubber bouncy ball completely impaled with toothpicks and threw it at me. He did this a total of three times before leaving the bus. Later he was expelled because I talked to my mother about it. I still have the scars on my arm and ankle from it.",1,,
"I was in my class 8 year in a different school. I had left the previous school due to the fact that I was being constantly scrutinized and picked on by my peers and was yearning for a fresh start. This didn’t happen though when a kid from my old school moved to my new school and started to spread horrible rumors that I was watching pornography. I am a person who has an extreme phobia of sex and even talking about it makes me nervous so my parents knew immediately that this was a lie. Another thing that they teased me for was for standing by one of my friends who is transgender. Luckily they talked to the principal and things were set straight for me to finish my year in peace. I’m still waiting to see how my junior year goes in high school and if I need to write again or not.",1,,
"today at recess a group of senior guys came up to me and my friends and started talking rudely to us. It made me feel bad. Then they held my sweater tightly and pushed me to the floor. Similar thing they've done to my friends. Then they started threatening that if we complain to the teachers, principal or our parents, then consequences will be terrible. Now I'm writing in your blog to open up about my recent situation that happened. Please help me and my friends if possible. His name was Lokesh. I don't know his full name and I also don't know their other names whom were being accompanied by him.",1,,
"I was just starting Middle school, and I had the same friends as I did in the 5th grade. I thought those friend were really close and really good to me, but the more I got to know them the more I realized that they only associated with me because of my best friend who everyone loved and adored. They normally would treat me like trash when my best friend wasn’t around.",1,,
